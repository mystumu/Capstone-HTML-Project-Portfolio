<h1>The Best Movies According to Mystden</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>When I saw this movie, I couldn't describe what I felt. A mix of emotion, nervousness, and happiness that ran through my entire body. I simply loved it, from the story, to the settings, the costumes, the atmosphere, the music, the sound, the characters, and how the scenes developed. Amazing.</p>

<h3>Evangelion 3.0+1.0</h3>
<p>Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon a Time is a movie that became my favorite anime-style film. Not just for how it concludes the story that the previous movies were building, but for the animation, execution, values, music, characters... Without a doubt, my second favorite movie.</p>

<h3>Look Back</h3>
<p>Look Back is a movie I watched with my girlfriend some time ago. The premise is simple: two girls who meet because they both publish in their school newspaper, one landscapes and the other comic strips. They become friends and decide to form a mangaka duo. The rest would be a spoiler so I won't tell more, but it's another movie worth watching.</p>
